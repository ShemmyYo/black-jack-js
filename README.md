# __Portfolio Project 2 - JavaScript__

## Blackjack 

> (formerly Black Jack and Vingt-Un) is a casino banking game. The most widely played casino banking game in the world, it uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as Twenty-One. This family of card games also includes the British game of Pontoon and the European game, Vingt-et-Un.[2] Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer.

This project is my take on this timeless game and the aim of this project is to build an interactive front-end webpage which uses HTM, CSS but most importingly JavaScript .

## __UX User Experience__

### __User Stories__

### __Wireframes__
Before writing any HTML or CSS, I used Eagle to gather ideas and Balsamiq to create wireframes.
Once completed, my wireframes were exported to pdf and coverted to png files with 

Home Page:

### __Site Structure__

Blackjack 2 page website. 

The home page is the default loading page which gaves the Player instructions as well is serving as logging in page (JS). 
Game page is where the JS magic happens and DOM is modiied - one page lets the user initiate and control actions, and gives feedback.

### __Colour Scheme__

I used <img height="12" src="https://github.com/ShemmyYo/black-jack-js/blob/main/assets/other/colormind-logo.png"> [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to find a perfect colour scheme that would tie-in with the classic feel of the page, be easily readable and visually appealing to users.

### __Typography__

The two fonts used were imported into the css from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

I used 'Luckest Guy' for logo, 'Syncopate' for all headings & any other text.

Sans-serif is the nominated fallback font

### __Imagery__

The images have been compressed in [compressor.io](https://compressor.io/) to enable faster loading times. 

The content images on Gallery Page are aligned in neat symmetrical grids for optimal viewing and user experience.
