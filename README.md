## Blackjack 

> (formerly Black Jack and Vingt-Un) is a casino banking game. The most widely played casino banking game in the world, it uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as Twenty-One. This family of card games also includes the British game of Pontoon and the European game, Vingt-et-Un.[2] Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer.

This project is my take on this timeless game and the aim of this project is to build an interactive front-end webpage which uses HTM, CSS but most importingly JavaScript .
